ETL pipeline, star schema, and Power BI dashboard

### Summary:
An end-to-end ETL pipeline in Python to ingest, clean, and transform e-commerce transaction data into a star schema (fact_transactions + dim_customers + dim_products + dim_date). Created analytics artifacts (aggregates, RFM segmentation, cohort analysis) and interactive dashboards in Power BI to help stakeholders monitor revenue, customer value, and product performance.

### Deliverables:

Raw + cleaned datasets (CSV)

dim_date, dim_products, dim_customers, fact_transactions CSVs

Jupyter Notebook with full ETL + visualizations

Power BI dashboard (design & DAX measures)

README, SQL DDL, and analyst recommendations


### Impact: 
Enables automated reporting, customer segmentation for retention campaigns, identification of high-value SKUs, and monitoring of return rates and payment performance.
